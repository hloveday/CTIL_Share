# CTIL_Share

Here are three exports of code from my source site. The custom posts and taxonomies were created and copied the CPT UI plugin and the code for activating the Divi Builder in the new post types comes from https://divi.space/tips-tricks/add-divi-builder-custom-post-types-one-function/.

I beleive this code needs to be added to the functions.php file on our CampusPress-based dev site.

I'm not sure if I should be using a Child theme for this, so let me know if you need one. I'd just use a vanila child theme based on the Divi theme.
